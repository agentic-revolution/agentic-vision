Read CLAUDE.md first. Then read every file in docs/planning/ in order: 01-vision.md, 02-map-spec.md, 03-implementation.md, 04-open-source.md. Once you've read all of them, run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` to scaffold the repo. Then open TASKS.md and execute every task from T-000 to T-721 sequentially. Do not skip tasks. Do not stop between tasks. Do not ask me for approval or confirmation at any point. If a task fails, debug and fix it yourself before moving on. Commit after each numbered task with the message format `T-XXX: description`. If a Rust dependency version doesn't compile, find the correct version and update Cargo.toml yourself. If a test fails, fix the code until it passes. Your goal is to build the entire Cortex project from an empty repo to a working v0.1.0 release in one continuous session. Begin now.
